John Ames is a preacher, the son of a preacher and the grandson (both maternal and paternal) of preachers. It\u2019s 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, towards the end of the Reverend Ames\u2019s life, and he is absorbed in recording his family\u2019s story, a legacy for the young son he will never see grow up. Haunted by his grandfather\u2019s presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father: the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist. He is troubled, too, by his prodigal namesake, Jack (John Ames) Boughton, his best friend\u2019s lost son who returns to Gilead searching for forgiveness and redemption. Told in John Ames\u2019s joyous, rambling voice that finds beauty, humour and truth in the smallest of life\u2019s details, Gilead is a song of celebration and acceptance of the best and the worst the world has to offer. At its heart is a tale of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, pitch-perfect in style and story, set to dazzle critics and readers alike.","product_name":"Gilead","product_picture":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=KQZCPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","product_price":29,"product_title":"","author_id":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"639b0e5d3b0c80838a4c38f5"},"category_id":1,"prodcut_num":17,"product_id":1,"product_intro":"A new 'Christie for Christmas' -- a full-length novel adapted from her acclaimed play by Charles Osborne Following BLACK COFFEE and THE UNEXPECTED GUEST comes the final Agatha Christie play novelisation, bringing her superb storytelling to a new legion of fans. Clarissa, the wife of a Foreign Office diplomat, is given to daydreaming. 'Supposing I were to come down one morning and find a dead body in the library, what should I do?' she muses. Clarissa has her chance to find out when she discovers a body in the drawing-room of her house in Kent. Desperate to dispose of the body before her husband comes home with an important foreign politician, Clarissa persuades her three house guests to become accessories and accomplices. It seems that the murdered man was not unknown to certain members of the house party (but which ones?), and the search begins for the murderer and the motive, while at the same time trying to persuade a police inspector that there has been no murder at all...

Frank lands in New York at age nineteen and gets a job at the Biltmore Hotel, where he immediately encounters the vivid hierarchies of this \"classless country,\" and then is drafted into the army and is sent to Germany to train dogs and type reports. It is Frank's incomparable voice that renders these experiences spellbinding. When Frank returns to America in 1953, he works on the docks, always resisting what everyone tells him. He knows that he should be getting an education, and though he left school at fourteen, he talks his way into New York University.
